[HEADING=1][COLOR=rgb(235, 107, 86)]Blood Tournament Reloaded[/COLOR][/HEADING]

This is a remade version of the Blood tournament map with my personal touch.

Players construct buildings that spawn groups of units in 7 free-for-all rounds.
You earn blood points by killing enemy units which can be spent to build or upgrade your units.
Featuring big battles and a lot of blood.

Choose a faction amongst Human, Orc, Undead, or Night Elf.
Experiment with different builds and find the optimal army composition.
Enjoy the mayhem!

[HEADING=2][COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]Game modes[/COLOR][/HEADING]
This version features multiple game modes to add some degree of replayability.
Red player has 60 seconds to choose the mode from the following list.

[HEADING=2][COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]Upgrade through items[/COLOR][/HEADING]
This version features an upgrade system using items bought by the building, you can :
- Add/replace an ability on a unit
- Add additional units to spawn
- Replace spawned units with another

Example:
- A 10x Footman building can add a captain and gain defend ability.

[HEADING=2][COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]Bots[/COLOR][/HEADING]
This game can be played with computer players, although they only build random things, I found it rather entertaining to play solo against 7 bots, better than nothing.
You can type -bot to be controlled by a bot.

[HEADING=2][COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]Known Issues[/COLOR][/HEADING]
Blizzard released a patch in November that impacted performance, this game can drop below 10 FPS with a high amount of units starting around 5.
Probably did shit code too.
I only played this game with 2 players and sadly encountered a desync a few times.
